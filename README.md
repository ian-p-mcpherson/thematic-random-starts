# Thematic Random Starts - A Noita Mod
A collection of starting loadouts that aim to be somewhat balanced with one another. This mod's goal is to make the first five to ten minutes of the game a fresh experience as many of the loadouts have a certain playstyle in mind.

There are currently 32 curated starting loadouts, and one of which will be given to the player at random when starting a new game.

A loadout consists of one perk, one or two thematic wands, an appropriate potion or two, and a snazzy robe color scheme to tie it all together.

An ingame options menu can be accessed to customize your experience at "Options > Mod settings > Thematic Random Starts".

Please leave comments, ideas, or balance suggestions in the discussion tab in the steam workshop via the link below.

# To Install
Download and unzip or check it out via Git into the "mods" directory in your Noita game installation, then activate it on the mods submenu ingame.

# Special Thanks
To the devs of the game for making a base for this mod and a lovely game and engine for me to play with.
