# Thematic Random Starts - A Noita Mod
A collection of random starts that aim to be somewhat balanced with one another, each designed to make the first few minutes of the game more interesting.

There are currently 21 loadouts that can be randomly assigned to you when you start a new game.

Loadouts usually have 1 perk, a HP modifier based on the effectiveness of the perk (game-changing perks will often have a penalty, fun or gimmicky perks will have none), a tailored wand or two, and a curated potion or two.

Please leave comments, ideas, or balance suggestions in the discussion tab in the steam workshop via the link below.

# To Install
Download and unzip under the "mods" directory in your Noita game install, then activate it on the mods submenu ingame.

This mod is also available via the steam workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2274888657

# Special Thanks
To the devs of the game for making a base for this mod and a lovely game and engine for me to play with.
