Tweaked values across the board for wands, loadouts, etc. (too many to list)
Moved all shield spells to always cast
Added descriptions to loadouts
Added puns
Converted all wands to new wand building code (nothing front-end, just makes new loadouts way easier to make)
UVs and loadout color files are now generated via script
