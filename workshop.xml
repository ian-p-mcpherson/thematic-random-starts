<Mod
	name="Thematic Random Starts"
	description="A collection of starting loadouts that aim to be somewhat balanced with one another. This mod's goal is to make the first five to ten minutes of the game a fresh experience as many of the loadouts have a certain playstyle in mind.

There are currently 32 curated starting loadouts, and one of which will be given to the player at random when starting a new game.

A loadout consists of one perk, one or two thematic wands, an appropriate potion or two, and a snazzy robe color scheme to tie it all together.


An ingame options menu can be accessed to customize your experience at Options > Mod settings > Thematic Random Starts.

Please leave comments, ideas, or balance suggestions in the discussion tab.

Check the code out on github if that's your thing: https://github.com/ian-p-mcpherson/thematic-random-starts"
